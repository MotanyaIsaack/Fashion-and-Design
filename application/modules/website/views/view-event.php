                <p class="font-17">
                    KikoRomeo showed its latest collection “Desert Rhapsody” at FIMA (Festival International de la
                    Mode Africaine) by Alphadi, in Dakhla, Western Sahara on 23rd November 2018. This was the first
                    time FIMA had been held outside Niger, and celebrated a coming together of artists, musicians
                    and designers from around Africa and beyond. The 4 day festival included a Music Festival, Young
                    Designer and Model Competition, Jewellery and Leatherwork show, Panafrican show and show of
                    Designers from 5 Continents. Guests stayed in elegant tents, modelled on a traditional Tuareg
                    style village.
                    The show opened with an outstanding couture cloak of wool with patchwork inserts. The cloak
                    picks on the shield motif in the Kenyan flag and symbolises the brand’s commitment to
                    sustainable fashion as fabric wastage is sewn into crazy patchwork, through a project which
                    incorporates 15 women groups across Western Kenya.
                    The rest of the collection was menswear, inspired by the idea of Maasai travelling through the
                    desert. Picking up on traditional reds and blues, KikoRomeo commissioned handwoven cotton checks
                    for dramatic scarves and turbans. These were teamed with layers of tunic shirts over skinny leg
                    pants, and accessorised with KikoRomeo by Baobab fishskin bags, done in collaboration with
                    Victoria Foods, who tanned the Nile Perch skins in Kitale.
