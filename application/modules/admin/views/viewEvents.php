This was the first time FIMA had been held outside Niger, and celebrated a coming together of artists, musicians and designers from around Africa and beyond. The 4 day festival included a Music Festival, Young Designer and Model Competition, Jewellery and Leatherwork show, Panafrican show and show of Designers from 5 Continents. Guests stayed in elegant tents, modelled on a traditional Tuareg style village.
The show opened with an outstanding couture cloak of wool with patchwork inserts. Picking up on traditional reds and blues, KikoRomeo commissioned handwoven cotton checks  for dramatic scarves and turbans. These were teamed with layers of tunic shirts over skinny leg pants, and accessorised with KikoRomeo by Baobab fishskin bags, done in collaboration with Victoria Foods, who tanned the Nile Perch skins  in Kitale.</td>
