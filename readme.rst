Frameworks and Tools Used
*******************

************************
Modular Extensions - HMVC
************************

Modular Extensions makes the CodeIgniter PHP framework modular. Modules are groups of independent components, 
typically model, controller and view, arranged in an application modules sub-directory that can be dropped into other CodeIgniter applications.

HMVC stands for Hierarchical Model View Controller.

Module Controllers can be used as normal Controllers or HMVC Controllers and they can be used as widgets to help you build view partials.

************************
DBV
************************

DBV is a database versioning tool

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
